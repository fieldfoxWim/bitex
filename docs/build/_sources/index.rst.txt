As easy as it is
----------------
Here is a simple example requesting the ticker info

.. code-block:: python

    from bitex import Bitfinex
    from bitex.pairs import ETHBTC

    def main():
        b = Bitfinex()
        response = b.ticker(ETHBTC)
        print(response.json())

    if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()

This example does not use authentication. It simply connects to the public API of Bitfinex and requests the ticker for ETH-BTC.
